# Introduction

This is a simple JavaScript project for loading MZ3 files.

The demo expects the files "three.min.js" and "gunzip.min.js" to be in the same folder as the provided "webgl_loader_mz3.html" and "MZ3Loader.js" files. You can get the required min.js files from the [three.js Github repository](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

Note that each of the sample models is loaded from the web. Most web browsers restrict HTML pages from loading files from the local disk. Therefore, if you wish to extend this tool you will need to put your meshes onto a web server or modify the security settings of your browser. This is not a limitation of the mz3 format, but a security feature of modern web browsers.
